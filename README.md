# Installation
This extension will probably work with Maven starting version 3.2.5.
Since this is a |Maven Core Extension], you must either install it directly into MavenHome/lib/ext or install it into [ProjectHome/.mvn/extensions.xml](http://takari.io/2015/03/19/core-extensions.html) (starting Maven 3.3.1).

# Usage
When installed, every maven build will produce a single build.payload file in target/ of the reactor project listing all artifacts requested by that build.
The output may be used for analytical purpose or picked up by other tooling like [payload-maven-plugin:deploy](https://github.com/rebaze/payload-maven-plugin)
